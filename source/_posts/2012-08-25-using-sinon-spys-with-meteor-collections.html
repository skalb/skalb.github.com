Following my testing described <a title="Testing Backbone Routers in Meteor with Mocha" href="http://www.skalb.com/2012/08/19/testing-backbone-routers-in-meteor-with-mocha/">here</a>, I wanted to verify that Meteor interacts with my Routers correctly.

<!--more-->

The Meteor.Collection object exposes methods for querying the MongoDB collection as described in the docs. I want to test if my index callback will retrieve all the items it should.

Add the new module we need:

[shell]
$ npm install sinon
[/shell]

Here's how to use the spy:

lib/sample_router_factory.coffee:
[coffee]
items =
  find: sinon.spy()
[/coffee]

Now, let's write our test:

tests/sample_router_factory_test.coffee:
[coffee]
it &quot;should retrieve all items&quot;, -&gt;
  router.navigate('', true)
  items.find.called.should.equal true
[/coffee]

This will fail, since we need to first modify our Router to accept a collection as an argument and then call find on it.

lib/sample_router_factory.coffee:
[coffee]
root = exports ? this

class SampleRouterFactory
  constructor: (@Backbone, @Items) -&gt;

  getRouter: () -&gt;
    SampleRouter = @Backbone.Router.extend(
      routes:
        &quot;&quot;: &quot;index&quot;

      index: =&gt;
        items = @Items.find()
    )
    new SampleRouter

root.SampleRouterFactory = SampleRouterFactory
[/coffee]

This <em>should</em> pass, but yet doesn't. Why? Thinking about the assumption our test is making when using the a Backbone router, it likely depends on Backbone initialization. We can try this in our test, also:

[coffee]
Backbone.history.start
  silent: true
  pushState: true
[/coffee]

This doesn't work either because Backbone assumes we are in the browser when accessing <strong>window</strong>. I'm pretty sure this is not the approach I want. We don't need to add a dependency on Backbone's internal behavior to test a method of my Router. My previous test verifies that the root path will call an index method, so now I only need to call that index method and validate that behavior. This has the added benefit of simplifying the test.

Here's the final version of my tests:

tests/sample_router_factory_test.coffee:
[coffee]
util = require('util')
should = require('should')
Backbone = require('backbone')
sinon = require('sinon')
SampleRouterFactory = require('../client/lib/sample_router_factory').SampleRouterFactory

describe &quot;SampleRouter&quot;, -&gt;
  items =
    find: sinon.spy()

  factory = new SampleRouterFactory(Backbone, items)
  router = factory.getRouter(Backbone)

  it &quot;should have an index route&quot;, -&gt;
    router.routes[''].should.equal('index')

  it &quot;should retrieve all items when navigating to index&quot;, -&gt;
    router.index()
    items.find.called.should.equal true
[/coffee]

A bit roundabout, but in the end what I was trying to accomplish. Source <a href="https://github.com/skalb/meteor-examples/tree/master/mocha-router">here</a>.
