# Hero culture:
{% blockquote %}
Why do something now when you could be CELEBRATED for doing it at the last minute?
{% endblockquote %}


I think in recent times, we the collective software community (that I'm about to clearly over generalize) seem to be in agreement that hero culture is bad. If you're looking for this post to refute that, then you will be disappointed! Instead, this post will try to articulate why a culture that seems so obviously destined for failure persists and is...possibly even liked!

## Imagine the following scenario:

It's Friday before a big deadline. Everything needs to be in since there's other teams, customers, clients, management, THE ENTIRE WORLD relying on everything being good to go on Monday. Sound familiar? It should.

The engineers have checked in and tested all the features in scope. People are chatting about their weekend plans (possibly even around the water cooler or the bar area if this is a trendy startup) ready to head home. But, all is not well, a downstream team lead casually asks the PM about a feature his/her team is completely dependent on. Confident at first, the PM scans his/her usual suspect of tools (spreadsheets, JIRA, bug trackers, etc.) to verify everything is good to go.

Here's where our stories diverge.

### Story 1:

After a few minutes of frantic searching and seeing the proverbial sky falling, the PM realizes that somehow without every attempt to do any  integration, we didn't get ANY feedback from the downstream team on what they were missing! Talk about bad luck! Frantically yet sheepishly, the PM sidles over to the engineer(s) "responsible" for that feature.

"Hey, guys, sorry but we REALLY need this done, can we get it done over the weekend?"

The engineers in question, not wanting to commit the biggest offense in the corporate world of not being team players, begrudgingly agree. They work the entire weekend and miraculously finish everything! And like heroes returning for their homecoming, strut into the office Monday morning to much (and may I say well deserved) fanfare and applause. The big boss congratulates everyone for a job WELL DONE which everyone immediately recognizes as sincere by the prompts to cheer and/or applaud along with excessive use of sports analogies. Everyone is happy. Balance has been restored.

### Story 2:

Knowledgeable that the downstream tech lead has been involved with his team's development cycle since the beginning, our PM is immediately confused. There's no way this could have happened!

"How did we miss this?" is the first of the series of questions the PM bombards the tech lead.

PM: "Why didn't you bring this up at today's stand-up when we asked if anything was still pending?"
TL: "Oh, I have a conflict and instead of finding a suitable replacement to represent our team, I figured it was fine to skip this meeting. Meetings are a waste of time."

PM: "Ok, what about our weekly planning meeting where we decide the priorities for upcoming work?"
TL: "Again, meetings are boring, didn't I already say that?"

PM: "Ok, fine, but what about the multiple times over the past few months where we specifically asked you for feedback on the features that we released and if there was anything missing"
TL: "Sorry, we missed it until now, but no big deal. I have a few guys who have volunteered to work this weekend to help get his done! Go team!"

PM: "..."

PM: "You mean despite given all of these chances to "



Information, collaboration, iterative development are antitheses to hero culture.

Hero culture is (over)compensation for previous failure. Yes, things get missed and mistakes happen but to not even try to minimize incidents is just laziness and not the good programmer kind.
